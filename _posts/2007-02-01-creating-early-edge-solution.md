achievement: Created edge computing solution before the term existed

During the Mobile World Congress of 2014, SixSq announced what I believe was the **first edge computing solution**. Back then, terms like edge, or fog computing didn't exist. So to explain what we were doing, we called it a *cloud in a box*. It came from the realisation that the cloud had brought users a transformative way to deploy and manage applications in remote infrastructures (public or private) with ease and at scale. We wanted to bring the same user experience to the edge, but targeting much more constrained devices, outside the data center. Our cloud in a box product eventually became the *NuvlaBox* (a SixSq brand).

I explain this in a [video](https://youtu.be/l8XD8bHceOY) HPE produced with the European Space Agency (ESA). But like many good ideas, these did not come out of a vacuum.  It required the thoughts of a number of people, at SixSq and outside. [Lionel Schaub](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lionel-s-65a44459) and [Khaled Basbous](https://www.linkedin.com/in/khaled-basbous-a3b66760) both worked on this product as part of their masters thesis and an [InnoSuisse](https://www.innosuisse.ch/inno/en/home.html) project called [PAChA](https://sixsq.com/r-and-d/pacha), under the excellent supervision of [Professor Nabil Abdennadher](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nabil-abdennadher-0446802/) in computing engineering at HES/SO (hepia). Lionel and Khaled were too good, so we hired them! [Etienne Coulon](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ecoulon) and [Samuel Mellot](https://www.linkedin.com/in/samuelmellot)'s enthusiasm towards this early product and potential field of applications also helped me realise the full potential of edge computing. The name *Nuvla* was proposed by [Robert Branchat](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rbranchat) during a brainstorming session to find a name for our new software products and services. It means *cloud* in [Romansh](https://glosbe.com/rm/en/nüvla).

But being ahead of the market is hard. You have to educate, identify pains that different industries don't yet feel, and prove that your solution is the right fit. As an SME operating as a start-up, with limited budget and the need to generate revenue right now to feed the troops, the challenge was immense. Using European and Swiss research funds, we managed to bring our edge solution to production readiness in 2018.

In partnership with [Schréder](https://www.schreder.com/en) Switzerland, under the leadership of [Thomas Blum](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomas-blum-92088a16), we created the Volumlight product (a Schréder trademark), the first production grade smart city evolutive edge system, able to automatically control street lights based on traffic volume. This solution is now deployed across Europe and is being adopted by other system integrators and light manufacturers. Cities have recorded 20% to 40% energy savings using this system.

Other successes include the work we are doing with the European Space Agency (ESA), for which I've written a separate <button type="link" class="link-button" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#post-enabling-ai">entry</button>.

As commonly happens in startups, in the autumn of 2018 we decided to pivot. In fact, we did two pivots at the same time. The first one was to focus the company on edge computing as a service, the second was to jettison virtual machine management and adopt a container native strategy. This led to the release of [Nuvla v2](http://github.com/nuvla/) in June 2019 and [NuvlaBox v2](http://github.com/nuvlabox/) in August 2019, followed by the launch of [Nuvla.io](https://nuvla.io) in September 2019 (busy year!) This was made possible by the earlier arrival of [Cristóvão Cordeiro](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cristovaocordeiro/) from CERN in 2017. Cris brought key knowledge in [Docker](https://www.docker.com) and container technologies and led the charge towards the container native strategy we pivoted towards.

Edge is now everywhere, and I predict that as we come out of the current pandemic, we'll realise that way more remote operations are required, to reduce dependencies on humans having to be everywhere to keep our world ticking. I make this argument (in French) in a short interview with Geneva based Radio Lac economics show (segments [1](https://www.radiolac.ch/podcasts/parlons-economie-26032020-143450/) and [2](https://www.radiolac.ch/podcasts/parlons-economie-26032020-144141/)). I'm not sure what form it will take, but this is going to be fascinating to see, and hopefully it will enable humans to have more fulfilling activities and secured revenues. It might also give a clearer picture regarding what tasks are candidates to artificial intelligence (AI) or machine learning (ML), and what should remain a human task. I'm an optimistic and a bee lover, so I hope our climate and biodiversity will benefit from it as well.
