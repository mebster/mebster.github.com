achievement: Created edge computing solution before the term existed
---

During the Mobile World Congress of 2012, SixSq announced what I believe was the first edge computing solution. Back then, terms like edge, or fog computing didn't exist. So to explain what we were doing, we called it *cloud in a box*. It came from the realisation that the cloud had brought users a transformative way to deploy and manage applications in remote infrastructures (public or private) with ease and at scale. With the cloud in a box, which became the NuvlaBox in SixSq's branding, we wanted to bring the same user experience to the edge, but targeting much more constrained devices.

I explain this in a [video](https://youtu.be/l8XD8bHceOY) HPE produced with the European Space Agency (ESA). But like many good ideas, these didn't not come out of vacuum.  It required the thoughts of a number of people, at SixSq and outside. [Lionel Schaub](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lionel-s-65a44459) and [Khaled Basbous](https://www.linkedin.com/in/khaled-basbous-a3b66760) both work on this product as part of their masters thesis in computing engineering at HES/SO (hepia). They were too good, so we hired them! [Etienne Coulon](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ecoulon) and [Samuel Mellot](https://www.linkedin.com/in/samuelmellot)'s enthusiasm towards this early product and potential field of applications also helped me realise the full potential of edge computing.

But being ahead of the market is hard. You have to educate, identify pains that different industries don't yet feel, and prove that your solution is the right fit. As an SME operating as a start-up, with limited budget and the need to generate revenue right now to feed the troops, the challenge was immense. Using European and Swiss research funds, we managed to bring our edge solution to production readiness in 2018.

In partnership with Schréder Switzerland, under the leadership of [Thomas Blum](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomas-blum-92088a16), we created the Volumlight product (Schréder brand), the first smart city evolutive edge system, able to automatically control street lights based on traffic volume. This solution is now deployed across Europe and is being adopted by other system integrators and light manufacturers.

Other successes include the work we are doing with the European Space Agency (ESA), for which I've written a separate [success entry]().

In the autumn of 2018, we took the decision to pivote, with an immediate impact on SixSq's edge product. The first one was to focus the company on edge computing, the second was to jettison virtual machine management and adopt a container native strategy. This led to the release of Nuvla v2 and NuvlaBox v2 in the summer of 2019. This was made possible by the arrival of [Cristóvão Cordeiro](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cristovaocordeiro/) in 2017, also from CERN. Cris brought key knowledge in docker and container technologies. Cris led the charge towards the container native strategy we had pivoted towards.

Edge is now everywhere, and I predict that as we come out of the pandemic, we'll realise that way more remote operations are required, to reduce dependencies on humans having to be everywhere to keep our world ticking. I'm not sure what form it will take, but this is going to be fascinating to see, and hopefully it will enable humans to have more fulfilling activities and secured revenues. It might also give a clearer picture regarding what tasks are candidates to artificial intelligence (AI) or machine learning (ML), and what should remain a human task.
