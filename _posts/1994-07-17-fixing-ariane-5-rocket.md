During the 3rd year of my engineering study, I was selected for an exchange in France. I was fortunate to be able to do my degree thesis at Aérospatiale (now Airbus Defence and Space) on the Ariane 5 launcher. Comparing wind tunnel measurements, I discovered that the thermal protection system of the launcher was possibly undersized for the hypersonic phase of the flight. This was not only super exciting, it was also a race to verify this intuition. During the summer of 1993, while Aérospatiale staff where enjoying a well deserved vacation, I had a mighty Cray II pretty much to myself crunching 3D computation fluid dynamics models. This was my first encounter with the full power of software, and I've never looked back.

Finding this single anomaly was not good enough. The French engineering culture there did not enjoy uncertainty. I was therefore asked to research a semi-empirical method to characterise my findings, such that future wind tunnel measurements could be extrapolated to improve thermal designs at super sonic and hyper sonic speeds (that's where it heats-up big time).

My findings where summarised in an [AIAA publication](https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/10.2514/6.1995-6025) and presented at the *International Space Planes and Hypersonic Systems and Technologies Conferences* Chattanooga, Tennessee, USA. This was the first of a long series of public presentation and speeches I would give in my career. I hope I made my high school French and oral expression teacher, Christine Besson, proud.

This work would not have been possible without the amazing support and patience from by co-directors: Pascal Vincent and Frederic Jacquot, many more in the aerodynamics and aerothermal teams at Aérospatiale. Thank you so much to have managed to tame the energy of a wild and young French Canadian, just discovering the real world in all its wonders. You also gave me the self believe that given enough time and intensity, I could have a go at solving many hard problems.

I've since taken this lessen to the next level, where a well performing team can, when given the right tools and empowerment, give most challenging problem a real hard time.
