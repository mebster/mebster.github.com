During my 3rd year of engineering study, I was selected for an exchange in France. I was fortunate to be able to do my degree thesis at Aérospatiale (now now Airbus Defence and Space) on the Ariane 5 launcher. Comparing wind tunnel measurements, I discovered that the thermal protection system of the launcher was possibly undersized for the hypersonic phase of the flight. This was not only super exciting, it was also a race to verify this intuition. During the summer of 1993, while Aérospatiale staff where enjoying a well deserved vacation, I had a might Cray II crunching computation fluid dynamics models for me, pretty much alone. This was my first encounter with the full power of software, and I've never looked back.

Finding this single anomaly was not good enough. The French engineering culture there did not enjoy uncertainty. I was therefore asked to research a semi-empirical method to characterise my finding, such that future wind tunnel measurements could be extrapolated to improve thermal designs at super sonic and hyper sonic speeds (that's where it heats-up big time). 

My findings where summarised in a [AIAA publication](https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/10.2514/6.1995-6025) and presented at the International Space Planes and Hypersonic Systems and Technologies Conferences Chattanooga, Tennessee. This work would not have been possible with the amazing support and patience from by co-directors: Pascal Vincent and Frederic Jacquot. Thank you so much to have managed to tame the energy of a wild French Canadian, just discovering the real world in all its wonders. You also gave me the self believe that given enough time and intensity, I could have a go at many hard problems.

I've since taken this lessen to the next level, where a well performing team can, when given the right tools and empowerment, give most challenging problem a real hard time.
