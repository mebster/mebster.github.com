achievement: Use edge to cloud architecture to solve ESA's big data challenge
---

The other early success of our edge solution was with the European Space Agency (ESA). With the need to process on the ground terabytes of data daily and at numerous locations across the globe, ESA could not afford, nor was it feasible, to move this much raw data to the cloud. [Mark Dumville](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mark-dumville-a952375), from CEO of [NSL](https://www.nsl.eu.com), whom I new from early work with ESA on Galileo related work, had the foresight to imagine combining SixSq's edge capability and NSL's GNSS signale processing mastery. The result is an edge-to-cloud solution, capable of precessing petabytes of data daily, using a sophisticated strategy between processing stations (edge) and the cloud. The *Orchestra Director* for this work at SixSq is [Konstantin Skaburskas](https://www.linkedin.com/in/konstantinskaburskas/). Konstantin was the first engineer to join SixSq core development team, from CERN. I don't know that anyone had more impact on SixSq's ability to deliver than Konstantin.
