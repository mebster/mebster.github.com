I already described in <button type="link" class="link-button" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#post-ariane-5">this post</button> the inception of SixSq in 2007 from my drive to introduce cloud computing at CERN.

For a while, starting from my time in Germany (1997-2004), creating a company was something I wanted to try.  That and doing a PhD. So while working on my *cloud vs grid* position paper at CERN, after being convinced that cloud computing was the future, it was clear to me that I had the foundation for what could be a potentially successful company. But this is a scary (and crazy) endeavour. And *surround yourself with amazing people* was a really good piece of advice I got early on.

The people I had around me I would go into battle with were very clear: Louise Merifield and [Cal Loomis](https://www.linkedin.com/in/charlesloomis). Louise is my wife! Since we climbed our first multi-pitch rock face together (400m in the French Alps), our first 4000m peak, jumped from an airplane together (she went first!) and went as far as having kids together... there was no one else I would trust as my wing-lady. I had known Cal at CERN, working together on an architecture working group trying to herd architects and developers from across Europe to bring together a sensible grid infrastructure. Cal is super bright and has immense patience (something I hope rubbed off on me over the years). So once they took time to think about my proposal and decided to give it a try, we were off.

It's hard to summarise in a few words 12 years of hard and often fun work. Here for me are the highlights. We initially decided to bootstrap the company ourselves, as opposed to raising capital with business angels or investors. So we had a slow start, giving us time to explore and figure things out. Leaving CERN, I had a few months of sabbatical during which I focused on creating SixSq, with Cal joining part time after negotiating with his employer at the time: [CNRS](http://www.cnrs.fr).

In 2010, [Gartner](https://www.gartner.com/en) interviewed us and suggested that what we were doing was about 3 years ahead of the market and competition, and that we would probably be better off continuing on our own for the market to mature and our software as well. The first real trigger for SixSq was the award of the European Commission Seventh Framework Programme project: StratusLab. This 2.3M € project allowed us to hire software developers, and accelerate our software development.

In 2012, my old boss, [Bob Jones](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bobjonescern/) asked us to join the [Helix Nebula](https://www.helix-nebula.eu) initiative. This was a great way to reconnect with CERN and join the European effort to build a public/private cloud strategy to accelerate cloud adoption in European research and academia. Cloud brokerage and multi-cloud management was for a long time the target SixSq aimed at. But as we built both the software and our go-to-market strategy, it became clear that this path was tricky. It was relatively easy to link small contracts to get by, but it was challenging to identify truly scalable business. Nevertheless, I found the whole journey, from the initial lukewarm reception of my suggestion in 2007 that the cloud would overtake the grid (read the details <button type="link" class="link-button" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#post-ariane-5">here</button>), to being asked to join as a cloud subject matter expert,  very satisfying. CERN eventually ended up becoming a customer of SixSq.

Along the path, we built nice systems, most of the time leveraging our own open source software. A really productive collaboration was with ATOS, for whom we built three different private high performance clouds, targeting European research communities. Working with very large system integrators, like ATOS, gave us a wealth of information and knowledge about how to do business with such entities, as well as the challenges in repeating this type of business with similar companies.

In 2014, we started to realise that running a software development company on our own was becoming both difficult and stressful. Having our personal wealth entirely linked to the company was a challenge. And having myself and Louise, my wife, in the same boat, added to the pressure. My excellent friend, [Cédric Seynat](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cedricseynat/) presented me to a truly amazing man: Denis Gagnon. Telco engineer from McGill University and confirmed private pilot (I also fly single engine aircrafts), Mr Gagnon was then looking at rebuilding technology for his companies. Cloud computing being on his target list, we started talking. In 2014, he eventually bought 55% of SixSq, in a partnership that promised to bring in existing mature markets and customers to SixSq and extend his companies' reach with new cloud based technology offerings.  However, soon after Mr Gagnon was forced to leave his duties and step aside. We therefore never had the opportunity to work together as we had dreamt it, during our meetings, in Geneva, Ottawa and the ski slopes of Zermatt.

On the technology side, both Cal and I wanted to ensure we used the best software languages, frameworks and tooling available. In 2014, dissatisfied with the Java environment we had, we started exploring alternatives. We eventually chose Clojure, a LISP-like functional language, targeting the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). The elegance and expressiveness of the language allowed us to reduce our codebase significantly, improve testing and massively increase scalability. The Clojure community soon after released ClojureScript. This meant that with the same language, we could build meaningful front-end and back-end, not only using the same language, but often sharing the same code. Cal became a true wizard of the language, its ecosystem and frameworks. One regret I have is for Clojure not to have become more popular over the years. This means that recruiting experienced Clojure/ClojureScript developers is challenging.  But since the language is reasonably easy to learn (after a mind shift into functional programming), we have recently had more success in training talented developers.

Cal eventually left in September 2019, moving back to Chicago, the place he calls home. It was a real honour to share this journey with him.

One important aspect, and a personal pride, in SixSq, is our smart and pretty much systematic usage of agile methodologies. My discovery of agile methodologies deserves its own entry, so I'll skip it for now. Throughout, we have applied (and regularly improved) our agile methodology. I was fortunate to learn from [Jeff Sutherland](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeffsutherland) (founder of [Scrum](https://www.scrum.org), the most popular agile methodology) himself. Learning by doing at SixSq, I trained a number of customers, including the [European Space Operations Centre](https://www.esa.int/About_Us/ESOC) of the European Space Agency. Not only did this give us revenue, it also opened up access to key stakeholders in the agency to build business. We now use a customised version of [Kanban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_(development)) and [DevOps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps).

Last year, SixSq had its best financial year, with a turn over of 2.5M CHF and a healthy margin. But it's the team that I'm the most proud of. The pivot to *edge as a Service* is truly exciting and I can't wait to see this team deliver its wonders to the market.
