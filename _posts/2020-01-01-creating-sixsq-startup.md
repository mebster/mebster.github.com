I already described in <button type="link" class="link-button" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#post-ariane-5">this post</button> the inception of SixSq in 2007 from my drive to introduce cloud computing at CERN.

For a while, back in Germany (1997-2004), creating a company was something I wanted to try.  That and doing a PhD. So while working on my *cloud vs grid* position paper at CERN, after being convinced that cloud computing was the future, it was clear to me that I had the foundation for what could be a potentially successful company. But this is a scary (and crazy) endeavour. And surrounding yourself with amazing people was a really good advise I got early on (don't remember from where though).

The people I had around me I would go into battle with were very clear: Louise Merifield and [Cal Loomis](https://www.linkedin.com/in/charlesloomis). Louise is my wife! Since we climbed our first multi-pitch rock face together (400 in the French Alps) and our first 4000m peak, jumped from an airplane together (she went first!) and went as far as having kids together... there was no one else I would trust as my wing-lady. I had known Cal at CERN, working together on an architecture working group trying to herd architects and developers from across Europe to bring together a sensible grid infrastructure. Cal is super bright and has immense patience (something I hope rubbed on my over the years).

It's hard to summarise in a few words 12 years of hard and often fun work. Here are for me the highlights. We initially decided to bootstrap the company ourselves.
