Being based in Geneva, I've yearned for a long time to contribute to the humanitarian effort that our city is so well known for.

Humanitarian organisations, however, are quite rightly allergic to *technology push*. We technologists too often fall victim to using technology when an old-fashioned screwdriver will do, and push techie solutions too early. So many times was I stonewalled during discussions with representatives from humanitarian organisations when I tried to push how edge or cloud solutions could be beneficial to humanitarian efforts. The mission of most humanitarian organisations is sensitive and critical, and funding constrained, and it is therefore not surprising that this creates a naturally conservative culture regarding software and IT innovations. Yet it is exactly these organisations which should have the very best tools and technology at their disposal.

This was epitomised recently during a security certification meeting with one NGO (I can't yet name the organisation), where the technical lead reminded us that in the past the organisation had lost lives due to a poorly cyber protected system. Indeed a malevolent party managed to detect the location of a team following an online discussion, leading to the bombing of their location.  Therefore, while working with humanitarian organisations gives a great feeling of reward, it's also very serious business. I therefore now treat this line of work as if we were in a military setting. In other words, would I entrust our lives to our software? It's a big mind shift.

This customer is now deploying edge systems in Africa and the Middle East.  These systems are used in field clinics, in order to offer a locally highly available IT system for clinical patient tracking and medical inventory management. On top of that, since it's an edge system, it can be operated remotely, when online. This allows the organisation to centralise its IT operations, and completely avoid having to deploy IT personnel in the field. This means each field mission can focus its key objective of deploying medical and support staff, and save on operations costs, while ensuring an industrial grade local IT infrastructure.

But I want this to work at scale, since, unfortunately, many NGOs will need this type of solution, and need to deploy them quickly (crises don't wait for the conclusion of a working group and an enquiry). To facilitate this, software and hardware teams must tightening their relationship. For example, when ordering from [OnLogic](https://www.onlogic.com), customers could soon be able to choose our preinstalled edge software (next to Windows and Ubuntu) as their operating system. This will mean NGOs will be able to order systems online and have them shipped directly to the field, without having to transit via Geneva (or another headquarter) to be configured. This will significantly shorten the time between order and a running system, anywhere in the world, without any impact on security. At a time when reactivity saves lives, I strongly believe that IT system providers must up their game to ensure that our customers are able to mobilise, securely and affordably, complex systems within hours. This is a revolution that brings purposeful technology to the benefit of critical humanitarian effort! I'm proud to be part of this effort.
