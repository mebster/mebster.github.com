Being based in Geneva, for a while, I've yearned to contribute to the humanitarian effort that our city is the central nervous system of.

If there's one industry that is allergic to technology push, as we technologists too often fall victim of, the humanitarian industry is it. How often was I stoned walled during cocktail discussion regarding how could our edge or cloud solutions be beneficial to humanitarian efforts. Second, because the mission of most humanitarian organisations are sensitive and critical, and funding constrained, it naturally creates a conservative culture.

This was epitomised recently during a security certification meeting with one NGO (I can't yet name the organisation), the technical lead reminded us that organisations in the past have lost lives where their location was detected by criminal organisations (countries or groups) and bombed soon after.  Therefore, while working with humanitarian organisations is a big time feel good thing, it's very serious business indeed. I therefore since treat this line of work as if we were in a military setting, in other words, would I trust our software with our lives? It's a big mind shift.
