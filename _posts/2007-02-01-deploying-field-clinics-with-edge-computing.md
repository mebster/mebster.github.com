Being based in Geneva, for a long time, I've yearned to contribute to the humanitarian effort that our city is so well known for.

But there's one industry that is allergic to *technology push*, as we technologists too often fall victim of, the humanitarian industry is *it*. How often was I stoned walled during cocktail discussion regarding how could our edge or cloud solutions be beneficial to humanitarian efforts? The mission of most humanitarian organisations is sensitive and critical, and funding constrained, it is therefore not surprising that this creates a naturally conservative culture regarding software innovation.

This was epitomised recently during a security certification meeting with one NGO (I can't yet name the organisation), where the technical lead reminded us that the organisation in the past have lost lives because a poorly cyber protected system. Indeed a malevolent party managed to detect the location of a team following an online discussion, leading to the bombing of their location, resulting in death.  Therefore, while working with humanitarian organisations is a big time feel good thing, it's also very serious business. I therefore since treat this line of work as if we were in a military setting, in other words, would I trust our software with our lives? It's a big mind shift.

The customer is now deploying edge systems in Africa and the Middle East.  These systems are used as field clinics, in order to offer a locally highly available IT system for clinical patient tracking and medical inventory management. But since it's an edge system, it can be operated remotely, when online. This allows the organisation to centralise its IT operations, and completely avoid having to deploy IT personnel in the field. This means each field mission can focus on deploying medical and support staff, thus saving on operations costs, while ensuring an industrial grade local IT infrastructure.

In the process, we are tightening our relationship with hardware manufacturers. For example, when ordering from [OnLogic](https://www.onlogic.com), customers could soon be able to choose *NuvlaBox OS* (next to Windows and Ubuntu) as their operating system. This will have the significant benefit of being able to ship edge hardware directly to sites, without having to transit via Geneva (or another headquarter) to be configured. This would significantly shorten the time between order and production, anywhere in the world, without any impact on security. At a time when reactivity saves lives, I strongly believe that IT system providers must up their game to ensure that our customers are able to mobilise, securely and affordably, complex systems within hours. This is a revolution that being purposeful technology to the benefit of critical humanitarian effort! I'm proud to be part of it.
