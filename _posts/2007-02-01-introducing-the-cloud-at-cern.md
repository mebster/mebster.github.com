achievement: Introducing cloud technology to CERN
---

In 2007, in a conference in Manchester, I heard Tony Hey present two new services that Amazon had just announced: the Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) and the Simple Storage Service. Using the web to deliver on-demand computing, in a simple and scalable way was, to me was a paradigm shift. In the 90s, so many giants had tried and failed to deliver a successful on-demand service, yet Amazon's proposal was simple and elegant.

At that time, CERN IT's strategy was entirely focused on grid technologies, building massively distributed job execution clusters, using traditional technologies. The collaboration went as far as even maintaining its own Linux distribution, imposed to all users.

Cloud computing was transformational on so many levels. From the technology stand-point, virtualisation was solving the problem of isolation and giving users the choice of running their own operating system (no need to impose anything here). On the service delivery side, a commercial offering was available challenging the different laboratories contributing to the grid effort, including CERN, to better understand its total cost of ownership (TCO), in order to compare with the prices proposed by Amazon.

My ideas were not always welcome, from gentle dismissals to stronger rebuffs.  But my boss back then, Bob Jones, was kind enough to give me space such that I could perform a comparative study between the grid and the cloud, and write a [position paper](https://edms.cern.ch/ui/file/925013/4/EGEE-Grid-Cloud-v1_2.pdf).

I'll let you read the paper if you want the detail, I hope it aged reasonably well.  But if you're impatient, the main conclusion was that the cloud was there to stay, and grid applications would be built on top of the cloud. This turns out to be true.

I'd like to acknowledge the contributions of my reviewers for this paper. Special thanks go to [James Casey](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jamesc000) for keeping me honest and resist attempts to water down my thoughts and of course [Cal Loomis](https://www.linkedin.com/in/charlesloomis), who was brave enough to launch into the crazy adventure with me that became SixSq.

CERN has of course since become a strong advocate of cloud technologies, now running one of the largest scientific cloud. CERN even became a customer of SixSq. Happy days!
